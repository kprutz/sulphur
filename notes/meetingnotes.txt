Notes from meetings

For sulphur sensor:

raw pm2.5 - over 35 avg in 24 hours needs change, over 12 avg in a year
 - epa looks at micrograms per cubic meter
- how many days are over 35


https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table

PM2.5 - then PM10, NOX - then other toxins

Sassol is a bad one


FOR THE MEETING IN 2 WEEKS - June 4

TODO: - make a working doc for this
Get report of air emissions for last 2 weeks (FROM MEETING DAY COMING UP) so Cindy can say this is what was in YOUR AIR. Chart it and send to Cindy
    - try purple air data viz library
    - use colab


TODO: - make a working doc for this
What is permitted?
 - get AIs from Sarah
 - used LDEQ docs
 - look at the 4 risk by air toxins (carbon tetrachloride, ethylene oxide, formaldehyde, other)

We have the 2016-2021 data of what these sites all reported.
We want to chart what these sites were permitted for during those years as well as 2022/2023 if documents are available.

Sarah will figure out what permits are actually useful and where to look



Try to scrape all the addresses / coordinates for factories — Cindy has someone looking into this
- yellow highlights are within a 15 mile radius






June 13:

Air Quality -> Enforcement -> Legal —> all docs with our AIs —> convert pdf to text —> upload to db —> search db for keywords (hearing)

      “notice of hearing”
      “proposed emissions”
      annual report

Email alerts + spreadsheet of alerts WHEN
  - new permit uploaded, application submitted, application pending
  - 3271, 1255
  - enforcement -> “permit renewal” OR “annual compliance certification” OR “Title V”


Make colab that connects to database for searching by Cindy/Team


Compliance -> Warning Letter

Jul 7:

EPA tables — may have a table of unreported emissions, so should look here before trying to scrape pdfs


PDFs
 - find pdfs with violations - get dates of event and locale
 - check purple air for those dates and times


Sulphur + south east Texas (including Beaumont)
